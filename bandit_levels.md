## Level 0 → 1

### Date Completed: 2025-08-21

### Level Goal
> Find the password for Level 1.

### Level Instructions / Hint
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

### Initial Thoughts
> I needed to locate and read the `readme` file. I tried several commands to find it and understand its type before successfully reading its contents.

### Commands Tried
```bash
find file readme
# output: find: ‘file’: No such file or directory
readme
# Learned that 'find file' is not a valid command

find readme
# output: readme
# Successfully located the readme file

ls readme
# output: readme
# Confirms that the readme file exists in the current directory

cd readme
# output: -bash: cd: readme: Not a directory
# Learned that readme is a file, not a folder

cat readme
# output: Congratulations on your first steps into the bandit game!!
